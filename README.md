# LearnLink
Our app is called LearnLink. This app is to match student with other students
to create study groups for their course. The app will allow the user to create a login page. 
If the user already has a login page then they can just sign in.
Users can message eachother, create a profile and match with other users for what requirements they want with their study group. 
Users can use the resources and have a personal grade calculator as well.


## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader
can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup.

You only need to add instructions for the OS you are using.

## Setup


Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.

Navigate to the server directory and enter these commands in the command line of the terminal
```
npm i ts-node typescript nodemon @types/cors @types/express @types/node @types/jsonwebtoken --save-dev
npm i @prisma/client cors express prisma bcrypt
```

Navigate to the ui directory and enter these commands in the command line of the terminal
```
npm install web-vitals
npm install @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install --save-dev @types/testing-library__react @types/jest @types/react-dom
```

## Running

Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**.

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
